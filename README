ASCIIpict is a program to generate ASCII pictures from PBM or PGM
pictures. PBM is the black and white variant of the PNM format 
while PGM is grayscale PNM.
Using the PGM format leads more uniform pictures than with the PBM
format. Preprocess your picture so that it is well-contrasted, not to
bright and not too dark.


REQUIREMENTS:

Compilation requires Objective Caml 3.0, see http://caml.inria.fr


INSTALLATION:

From the source directory, type:
  make

If it doesn't work, then try with the bytecode compiler by typing:
  make byte-code

Copy the executable named 'asciipict' where you want.
To saved disk space, type:
  make clean

If you want it to run a bit faster, you may try:
  make OCAMLFLAGS=-unsafe
instead of 'make'.


NOTES:

Compilation with ocamlopt produces native code which is here 
about 13 times faster than the bytecode produced by ocamlc.
